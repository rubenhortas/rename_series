rename_series
===========

	rename_series is a python application that renames series, subtitles
	and puts the subtitles to the chapters.
	
	Basically, this application search in one (or more directories) for 
	series and subtitles in various languages. 
		* I have series in spanish and english. 
	
	First renames the chapters to a nice format:
		<show name> <season>x<episode> [<episode title>] [(VO)].<extension> 
		
		* The only series taken as spanish are the downloaded from 
			spanishtracker (newpct). You can configure this.
	
	Then renames the subtitles.
	
	Then puts the subtitles to the corresponding chapters, putting the same name
	of the subtitle to the video file.
